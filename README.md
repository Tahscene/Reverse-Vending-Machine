<h1>♻️ EcoDrop: Smart Reverse Vending Machine for Plastic and Metal Waste</h1>

<p>
  <strong>EcoDrop</strong> is an innovative <strong>Reverse Vending Machine (RVM)</strong> designed for intelligent waste disposal. It accepts empty plastic bottles and metal cans, identifying them using a proximity sensor and encouraging recycling through an incentive-based system. This solution addresses the ongoing challenge of plastic and metal waste pollution in our environment.
</p>

<h2>📄 Project Overview</h2>
<p>
  The EcoDrop RVM is a smart, automated solution that contributes to effective waste management. With built-in sensors, it detects and distinguishes between different types of recyclable containers. It aims to minimize environmental damage caused by improper waste disposal and motivate individuals to engage in recycling practices through rewards or incentives.
